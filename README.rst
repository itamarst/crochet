Crochet: Asynchronous Calls from Threaded Applications
======================================================

Crochet is an MIT-licensed library that makes it easier for threaded
applications like Flask or Django to use the Twisted networking framework, by
providing:

* An API to help threads interact with Twisted APIs, which are not thread-safe
  by default.
* The ability to easily run the Twisted reactor in the background.

Bugs and feature requests should be filed at the project `Github page`_.


Quick Example
-------------

Here's an example of a program using Crochet:

.. code-block:: python

  import sys

  from twisted.web.client import getPage
  from crochet import setup, run_in_reactor
  setup()

  @run_in_reactor
  def download_page(url):
      return getPage(url)

  result = download_page(sys.argv[1])
  # wait() returns the result when it becomes available:
  print result.wait()

Run on the command line::

  $ python example.py http://google.com
  <!doctype html><html itemscope="itemscope" ... etc. ...

Notice that you get a completely blocking interface to Twisted, and do not
need to run the Twisted reactor, the event loop, yourself.


Longer Example
--------------

Why should you care about using Twisted? Because it gives you the full power
of an event-driven networking framework from inside your applications. For
example, you can use it to schedule events that will run in the background
without slowing down the page rendering of your web applications:

.. code-block:: python

    """
    An example of scheduling time-based events in the background.

    Download the latest EUR/USD exchange rate from Yahoo every 30 seconds in the
    background; the rendered Flask web page can use the latest value without
    having to do the request itself.

    Note this is example is for demonstration purposes only, and is not actually
    used in the real world. You should not do this in a real application without
    reading Yahoo's terms-of-service and following them.

            return d

News
----

**Next release**

* EventualResult.wait() now raises error if called in the reactor thread.
* Unittests are now included in the release tarball.
* Allow Ctrl-C to interrupt `EventualResult.wait(timeout=None)`.

**0.7.0**

* Improved documentation.

**0.6.0 (unreleased)**

* Renamed ``DeferredResult`` to ``EventualResult``, to reduce confusion with
  Twisted's ``Deferred`` class. The old name still works, but is deprecated.
* Deprecated ``@in_reactor``, replaced with ``@run_in_reactor`` which doesn't
  change the arguments to the wrapped function. The deprecated API still works,
  however.
* Unhandled exceptions in ``EventualResult`` objects are logged.
* Added more examples.
* ``setup.py sdist`` should work now.

**0.5.0**

* Initial release.


Features
--------

* Runs Twisted's reactor in a thread it manages.
* Hooks up Twisted's log system to the Python standard library ``logging``
  framework. Unlike Twisted's built-in ``logging`` bridge, this includes
  support for blocking `Handler` instances.
* Provides a blocking API to eventual results (i.e. ``Deferred`` instances).


Using Crochet in Blocking Code
------------------------------

Using Crochet involves three parts: reactor setup, defining functions that
call into Twisted's reactor, and using those functions.


Setup
^^^^^

Crochet does a number of things for you as part of setup. Most significantly,
it runs Twisted's reactor in a thread it manages. Doing setup is easy, just
call the ``setup()`` function:

.. code-block:: python

  from crochet import setup
  setup()

Since Crochet is intended to be used as a library, multiple calls work just
fine; if more than one library does ``crochet.setup()`` only the first one
will do anything.


Using Crochet from Twisted Applications
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If your application is already planning on running the Twisted reactor itself,
Crochet's default behavior of running the reactor in a thread is a problem. To
solve this, Crochet provides the ``no_setup()`` function, which causes future
calls to ``setup()`` to do nothing. Thus, an application that will run the
Twisted reactor but also wants to use a Crochet-using library must run it
first:

.. code-block:: python

    from crochet import no_setup
    no_setup()
    # Only now do we import libraries that might run crochet.setup():
    import blockinglib

    # ... setup application ...

    from twisted.internet import reactor
    reactor.run()


Creating Asynchronous Functions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Now that you've got the reactor running, the next stage is defining some
functions that will run inside the Twisted reactor thread. Twisted's APIs are
not thread-safe, and so they cannot be called directly from another
thread. Instead, we write a function that is decorated with
``crochet.run_in_reactor``:

.. code-block:: python

  from twisted.internet import reactor
  from crochet import run_in_reactor

  @run_in_reactor
  def call_later(delay, f, *args, **kwargs):
      reactor.callLater(delay, f, *args, **kwargs)

  call_later(30, sys.stdout.write, "30 seconds have passed.\n")

Decorating the function with ``run_in_reactor`` has two consequences:

* When the function is called, the code will not run in the calling thread,
  but rather in the reactor thread.
* The return result from a decorated function is an ``EventualResult``, which
  will be discussed in the next section.


Asynchronous Results
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Since the code in the decorated function will be run in a separate thread, its
return result or raised exception cannot be returned normally. Moreover, the
code may return a ``Deferred``, which means the result may not be available
until that ``Deferred`` fires. To deal with that, functions decorated with
``crochet.run_in_reactor`` return a ``crochet.EventualResult`` instance.

``EventualResult`` has the following methods:

* ``wait(timeout=None)``: Return the result when it becomes available; if the
  result is an exception it will be raised. If an optional timeout is given
  (in seconds), ``wait()`` will throw ``crochet.TimeoutError`` if the timeout
  is hit, rather than blocking indefinitely.
* ``cancel()``: Cancel the operation tied to the underlying
  ``Deferred``. Many, but not all, ``Deferred`` results returned from Twisted
  allow the underlying operation to be canceled. In any case this should be
  considered a best effort cancellation.
* ``stash()``: Sometimes you want to store the ``EventualResult`` in memory
  for later retrieval. This is specifically useful when you want to store a
  reference to the ``EventualResult`` in a web session like Flask's (see the
  example below). ``stash()`` stores the ``EventualResult`` in memory, and
  returns an integer uid that can be used to retrieve the result using
  ``crochet.retrieve_result(uid)``. Note that retrieval works only once per
  uid. You will need the stash the ``EventualResult`` again (with a new
  resulting uid) if you want to retrieve it again later.

In the following example, you can see all of these APIs in use. For each user
session, a download is started in the background. Subsequent page refreshes
will eventually show the downloaded page.

.. code-block:: python

    """
    A flask web application that downloads a page in the background.
    """

    import logging
    from flask import Flask, session, escape
    from crochet import setup, run_in_reactor, retrieve_result, TimeoutError

    # Can be called multiple times with no ill-effect:
    setup()

    app = Flask(__name__)


    @run_in_reactor
    def download_page(url):
        """
        Download a page.
        """
        from twisted.web.client import getPage
        return getPage(url)


    @app.route('/')
    def index():
        if 'download' not in session:
            # Calling an @run_in_reactor function returns an EventualResult:
            result = download_page('http://www.google.com')
            session['download'] = result.stash()
            return "Starting download, refresh to track progress."

        # retrieval is a one-time operation, so the uid in the session cannot be reused:
        result = retrieve_result(session.pop('download'))
        try:
            download = result.wait(timeout=0.1)
            return "Downloaded: " + escape(download)
        except TimeoutError:
            session['download'] = result.stash()
            return "Download in progress..."


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        import os, sys
        logging.basicConfig(stream=sys.stderr, level=logging.DEBUG)
        app.secret_key = os.urandom(24)
        app.run()
