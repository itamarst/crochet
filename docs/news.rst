What's New
==========

1.4.0
^^^^^

New features:

* Added support for Python 3.4.
* ``wait_for`` and ``run_in_reactor`` now preserve signature of the wrapped
   functions due to use of the ``decorator`` module. Thanks to Mikhail Terekhov
   for the patch.

1.3.0
^^^^^

Bug fixes:

* It is now possible to call ``EventualResult.wait()`` (or functions
  wrapped in ``wait_for``) at import time if another thread holds the
  import lock. Thanks to Ken Struys for the patch.

1.2.0
^^^^^
New features:

* ``crochet.wait_for`` implements the timeout/cancellation pattern documented
  in previous versions of Crochet. ``crochet.wait_for_reactor`` and
  ``EventualResult.wait(timeout=None)`` are now deprecated, since lacking
  timeouts they could potentially block forever.
* Functions wrapped with ``wait_for`` and ``run_in_reactor`` can now be accessed
  via the ``wrapped_function`` attribute, to ease unit testing of the underlying
  Twisted code.

API changes:

* It is no longer possible to call ``EventualResult.wait()`` (or functions
  wrapped with ``wait_for``) at import time, since this can lead to deadlocks
  or prevent other threads from importing. Thanks to Tom Prince for the bug
  report.

Bug fixes:

* ``warnings`` are no longer erroneously turned into Twisted log messages.
* The reactor is now only imported when ``crochet.setup()`` or
  ``crochet.no_setup()`` are called, allowing daemonization if only ``crochet``
  is imported (http://tm.tl/7105). Thanks to Daniel Nephin for the bug report.

Documentation:

* Improved motivation, added contact info and news to the documentation.
* Better example of using Crochet from a normal Twisted application.

1.1.0
^^^^^
Bug fixes:

* ``EventualResult.wait()`` can now be used safely from multiple threads,
  thanks to Gavin Panella for reporting the bug.
* Fixed reentrancy deadlock in the logging code caused by
  http://bugs.python.org/issue14976, thanks to Rod Morehead for reporting the
  bug.
* Crochet now installs on Python 3.3 again, thanks to Ben Cordero.
* Crochet should now work on Windows, thanks to Konstantinos Koukopoulos.
* Crochet tests can now run without adding its absolute path to PYTHONPATH or
  installing it first.

Documentation:

* ``EventualResult.original_failure`` is now documented.

1.0.0
^^^^^
Documentation:

* Added section on use cases and alternatives. Thanks to Tobias Oberstein for
  the suggestion.

Bug fixes:

* Twisted does not have to be pre-installed to run ``setup.py``, thanks to
  Paul Weaver for bug report and Chris Scutcher for patch.
* Importing Crochet does not have side-effects (installing reactor event)
  any more.
* Blocking calls are interrupted earlier in the shutdown process, to reduce
  scope for deadlocks. Thanks to rmorehead for bug report.

0.9.0
^^^^^
New features:

* Expanded and much improved documentation, including a new section with
  design suggestions.
* New decorator ``@wait_for_reactor`` added, a simpler alternative to
  ``@run_in_reactor``.
* Refactored ``@run_in_reactor``, making it a bit more responsive.
* Blocking operations which would otherwise never finish due to reactor having
  stopped (``EventualResult.wait()`` or ``@wait_for_reactor`` decorated call)
  will be interrupted with a ``ReactorStopped`` exception. Thanks to rmorehead
  for the bug report.

Bug fixes:

* ``@run_in_reactor`` decorated functions (or rather, their generated wrapper)
  are interrupted by Ctrl-C.
* On POSIX platforms, a workaround is installed to ensure processes started by
  `reactor.spawnProcess` have their exit noticed. See `Twisted ticket 6378`_
  for more details about the underlying issue.

0.8.1
^^^^^
* ``EventualResult.wait()`` now raises error if called in the reactor thread,
  thanks to David Buchmann.
* Unittests are now included in the release tarball.
* Allow Ctrl-C to interrupt ``EventualResult.wait(timeout=None)``.

0.7.0
^^^^^
* Improved documentation.

0.6.0
^^^^^
* Renamed ``DeferredResult`` to ``EventualResult``, to reduce confusion with
  Twisted's ``Deferred`` class. The old name still works, but is deprecated.
* Deprecated ``@in_reactor``, replaced with ``@run_in_reactor`` which doesn't
  change the arguments to the wrapped function. The deprecated API still works,
  however.
* Unhandled exceptions in ``EventualResult`` objects are logged.
* Added more examples.
* ``setup.py sdist`` should work now.

0.5.0
^^^^^
* Initial release.
